# RoboDesk
Arduino code for LOGICDATA protocol and remote handset hacking for automated standing desk

Current features:
* Double tap a direction to go to a target height


Next steps:
* 5v shifting, because the latching is weird
* Figure out what's up with the debounced button read vs button read
* Fully MitM the buttons
* Add 7 seg display for height?
